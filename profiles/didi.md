## I'm Didi, 

and I have a strong interest in spatial statistics and related fields. 

I enjoy exploring data, analyzing spatial patterns, and leveraging statistical techniques to solve real-world problems. 

I am eager to learn new skills and collaborate on projects that involve spatial data analysis.
